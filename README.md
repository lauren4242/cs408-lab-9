# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

This project displays a page with circles that move across the screen
at varying speeds and colors, and when the circles collide, they change colors.
It also creates an "Evil Circle" that can be moved through the WASD keys, that
consumes other circles when they collide. There is a counter in the top right
right that keeps track of the amount of circles aside from the Evil Circle on
the screen.
